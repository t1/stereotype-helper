<body>
Helps libraries to support stereotypes, so their users can encapsulate the libraries' annotations into their own, allowing to reuse them.

<h3>Features Supported</h3>
<ul>
	<li>{@link Stereotype} (careful: this is our own type!) works just
		as with CDI: Inherit the library-annotations on the user-annotation to the site-of-use.  
	<li>Annotation parameters from the user-annotation are propagated into your annotations.
	<li>Type and Field annotations
</ul>

<h3>Features Not Yet Supported</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Method, etc. annotations
	<li>Allow adding library-annotations and properties from (xml?) config files (deployment descriptors)
	<li>Default annotations on classes and packages
</ul>
</body>
