<body>
	Helps libraries to support stereotypes, so their users can encapsulate
	the libraries' annotations into their own, allowing to reuse them.

	<h3>Features Supported</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>{@link Stereotype} (careful: this is our own type!) works
			just as with CDI: Inherit the library-annotations on the
			user-annotation to the site-of-use.
		<li>Annotation parameters from the user-annotation are propagated
			into your annotations.
		<li>Propagate same-type, same-name annotations by annotating the
			container-method
		<li>Type, Field, and Method annotations
	</ul>

	<h3>Features Not Yet Supported</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Default annotations on classes and packages
		<li>PARAMETER, CONSTRUCTOR, LOCAL_VARIABLE, ANNOTATION_TYPE, and
			PACKAGE annotations
		<li>Allow adding library-annotations and properties from (xml?)
			config files (deployment descriptors)
	</ul>
</body>
